## Project Overview

- This project involves analyzing Adidas US sales data to understand sales trends, identify key performance metrics, and generate insights for business decision-making. The objective is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

## Project Goal

- To analyze Adidas sales performance across regions, products, and timeframes to:

1. Identify top-performing products and regions.

2. Track revenue growth or decline.

3. Provide data-driven recommendations for increasing sales.

## Data Source

- Content: Includes fields such as Retailer, Region, Product, Units Sold, Sales, Profit, Date, and more.

- Source Type: Excel-based structured dataset (manually or system-generated).

## Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation and visual analysis.

- Microsoft Excel for initial data storage.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures.

- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

  
## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Removed blank/null records.

- Formatted date and numerical columns.

- Standardized column names for clarity.

- Created new calculated columns (e.g., Month, Year).

## Data Analysis

- Created KPIs for total sales, units sold, and profit.

- Analyzed sales by:

1. Region

2. Product

3. Retailer

4. Time (Monthly/Yearly)

- Used visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and matrix tables.

- Included trend indicators for revenue changes.


## Findings / Results

- Top-performing Region: [To be filled based on visual output, e.g., "West Coast"]
 
- Top Product: [e.g., "Ultraboost Shoes"]

- Monthly Trend: [e.g., "Sales peak in Q4, drop in Q1"]

- Profitability: [e.g., "Retailers like Foot Locker showed higher profit margins"]

## Recommendations

- Focus marketing on high-performing regions and products.

- Increase inventory of top-selling items before peak seasons.

- Offer targeted promotions in low-performing regions.

- Optimize pricing strategies to improve profit margins.


## Limitations
